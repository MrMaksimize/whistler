# M1

This milestone is for conducting an initial field test of the units:

Here is where we should be:

- [ ] Units should be gps-enabled
- [ ] Units must be self-sustaining (solar + battery)
- [ ] We should have a basic covering for the sensors
- [ ] Sensor algo should be improved to determine baseline for that area, and transmit when that baseline is exceeded.  
- [ ] We should be collecting unstructured data from the sensors and streaming that out to a visual interface.  
- [ ] We should be able to do all this for 5 units.
